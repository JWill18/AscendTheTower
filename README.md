# AscendTheTower
A small 2D platformer prototype that was made using UE5 blueprints. Holds a couple of levels but is flexible enough to expand upon is wanted.

# Setup
This is a purely blueprint style project and can be opened currently with UE 5.0.

Download the project and run the .uproject file.

# Structure
The project is meant to be built in a way that multiple new levels should be able to be easily created using tilemaps and the existing blueprints. It is also built so that it should be easy to change and manipulate the logic to create new and interesting mechanics. The goal of each level is that there must be an object to be picked up to unlock the door to go to the next level.

# Characters
There are 3 characters to play as that offer different play styles.

## The Warrior
The warrior is meant to break barricades that block other characters from accessing certain areas

## The Wizard
The wizard is able to shoot a magic projectile to hit switches from far away

## The Rogue
The rogue is capable of double jumping and even wall jumping to reach new heights that the other characters can not.
